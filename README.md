A codebase that uses the Fat Free Framework (f3) to organize email templates, take user input and connect to ExactTarget for a send. 
Various methods for connecting to ExactTarget API will be organized into Controllers in the App directory.

This ExactTarget library is aging, will need to update soon, or maybe use FuelSDK. 
Note: There is a bug in the doRequest function
